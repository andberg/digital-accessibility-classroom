# Accessiblity Workshop - DevUX 2023


## Requirements

### Developer

#### This project is made with Angular and requires some preparations before we start. 

* You need to have node.js and npm package manager installed.
* Good to know is that the structure of an Angular app is usually in a .ts-file which contains logic 

## To run a local development server 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Designer

* If you are not usually coding you can instead go to the [vercel deployment](https://a11y-stellitzab.vercel.app/) where the code will be available. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.0.
